- Why Google Colaboratory ("Colab")?
  #+begin_quote
  Use Colab for zero setup, free compute, easy sharing. Runs anywhere
  via browser, integrates naturally with Python (Jupyter
  notebook). Helps you focus on ideas rather than infrastructure but
  also teaches good notebook and literate programming skills.
  #+end_quote

- Why R?
  #+begin_quote
  R lets you focus on thinking with data rather than fighting the
  language. It’s built for analysis, exploration, and experimentation,
  and it makes it easy to see what your code is actually doing. In
  this course, we mostly use base R so you learn skills that transfer
  to other languages and tools.
  #+end_quote

- Why these topics?
  #+begin_quote
  These topics reflect how data science work really happens: you get
  data, clean it, process it, write functions to reuse your work, and
  speed things up when needed. The goal is not just to “get results,”
  but to write code that is clear, reusable, and efficient—skills
  you’ll use long after this course ends.
  #+end_quote

- What's missing/what to study next?
  #+begin_quote
  This course focuses on foundations, not every data science
  technique. Topics like machine learning, advanced modeling, large
  databases, and production systems come later. The goal is to prepare
  you to learn those topics faster and more critically once you
  encounter them.
  #+end_quote

- Why are we not using Python?
  #+begin_quote
  Python is widely used in data science, but learning data science is
  not the same as learning a popular language. In this course, R
  provides a clearer and more direct way to explore data, write
  analytical code, and understand performance trade-offs. Once you
  understand these ideas, picking up Python—or any other
  language—becomes much easier.
  #+end_quote

* AI Demo + Assignment

- Between 1980 and 2020, Jobs classified as "high social/low math"
  (people with great social skills who can't do math) have a rising
  employment share and higher average real hourly wages ("more money")
  than jobs classified as "low social/high maths" (nerds who can do
  math, also called "quants").

* Getting started with Colab

Let's make a simple plot with R in Colab to revisit what you already
know.

1) Logon to your Lyon Google account.
2) Open ~colab.research.google.com~.
3) Create a ~New notebook~.
4) Download the ~iris~ dataset from Kaggle.
5) Load dataset into a ~data.frame~
6) Include exception handling with ~tryCatch~
7) Explore the dataset.
8) Create a simple plot.
9) Customize the plot.
10) Summarize and check your understanding with a lab exercise.

Lecture available [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds2-26/blob/main/ipynb/0_colab.ipynb][in GitHub]] (static) and [[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YRme5Q016McFl_TGk3D35DT8MZYfB2Du?usp=sharing][in Colab]] (interactive). To
open in Colab, use: [[https://tinyurl.com/colab-starter-ipynb][tinyurl.com/colab-starter-ipynb]] (make copy).

* Getting started with Colab - Lab exercise

Test your understanding of "Getting started with Colab" by creating a
notebook for the Palmer Penguin dataset available for you online from:
[[https://tinyurl.com/palmer-data-csv][tinyurl.com/palmer-data-csv]].

Tasks:
1) Create a new Colab notebook.
2) Load the dataset into a dataframe.
3) Check if the dataset is loaded in the current namespace.
4) Display the first few lines of the dataset.
5) Make a simple plot of the =bill_length_mm= vs. =bill_depth_mm=.
6) Make a fully customized plot of the dataset grouping by =species=.
7) Upload the URL to your notebook to Canvas.
