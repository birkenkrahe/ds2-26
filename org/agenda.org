- Why Google Colaboratory ("Colab")?
  #+begin_quote
  Use Colab for zero setup, free compute, easy sharing. Runs anywhere
  via browser, integrates naturally with Python (Jupyter
  notebook). Helps you focus on ideas rather than infrastructure but
  also teaches good notebook and literate programming skills.
  #+end_quote

- What is a Jupyter notebook?
  #+begin_quote
  Ju[lia]Py[thon]teR - pick one of these as runtime environment = now
  the notebook runs Julia, Python or R - all three work with SQL.

  You can use pretty much any other language using "magic" commands:
  they basically write the code as a file, and then you have to run it
  on the shell:

  ~%%writefile helloc~
   ...
  #+end_quote

- Why R?
  #+begin_quote
  R lets you focus on thinking with data rather than fighting the
  language. It’s built for analysis, exploration, and experimentation,
  and it makes it easy to see what your code is actually doing. In
  this course, we mostly use base R so you learn skills that transfer
  to other languages and tools.
  #+end_quote

- Why these topics?
  #+begin_quote
  These topics reflect how data science work really happens: you get
  data, clean it, process it, write functions to reuse your work, and
  speed things up when needed. The goal is not just to “get results,”
  but to write code that is clear, reusable, and efficient—skills
  you’ll use long after this course ends.
  #+end_quote

- What's missing/what to study next?
  #+begin_quote
  This course focuses on foundations, not every data science
  technique. Topics like machine learning, advanced modeling, large
  databases, and production systems come later. The goal is to prepare
  you to learn those topics faster and more critically once you
  encounter them.
  #+end_quote

- Why are we not using Python?
  #+begin_quote
  Python is widely used in data science, but learning data science is
  not the same as learning a popular language. In this course, R
  provides a clearer and more direct way to explore data, write
  analytical code, and understand performance trade-offs. Once you
  understand these ideas, picking up Python—or any other
  language—becomes much easier.
  #+end_quote

* DONE AI Demo + Assignment

- Between 1980 and 2020, Jobs classified as "high social/low math"
  (people with great social skills who can't do math) have a rising
  employment share and higher average real hourly wages ("more money")
  than jobs classified as "low social/high maths" (nerds who can do
  math, also called "quants").

* NEXT Review questions: Critiquing a plot

Q&A by ChatGPT (extracted exclusively from the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iye6yXDJHQhBOfCebotwX2XmppeWf2wF7ZkRBY_ProY/edit?usp=drive_link][chart critique]])

1. What is the first thing you should evaluate when you see the title
   of a data visualization?
   #+begin_quote
   Whether the title states a neutral description of the data or
   already implies a conclusion or causal claim.
   #+end_quote

2. Why is it problematic if a plot compares only two groups when more
   categories could reasonably exist?
   #+begin_quote
   It can create a false dichotomy by excluding relevant groups, which
   biases interpretation toward a simplified narrative.
   #+end_quote

3. What questions should you ask about how categories such as “high”
   and “low” are defined?
   #+begin_quote
   You should ask what thresholds are used, whether they are relative
   or absolute, and how sensitive the results are to those choices.
   #+end_quote

4. Why does the absence of historical or contextual annotations matter
   in a time-series plot?
   #+begin_quote
   Without context, trends may be misinterpreted as structural changes
   rather than responses to external events like recessions or shocks.
   #+end_quote

5. How can axis scaling affect the viewer’s perception of differences
   between groups?
   #+begin_quote
   Truncated or narrow axes can visually exaggerate small numerical
   differences, making trends appear more dramatic than they are.
   #+end_quote

6. What is the risk of presenting aggregate data without
   distinguishing subgroups such as industries or sectors?
   #+begin_quote
   Aggregation can hide opposing trends within subgroups, leading to
   conclusions that do not hold at a more detailed level.
   #+end_quote

7. Why should visual differences always be compared to the underlying
   numerical differences?
   #+begin_quote
   Because visual impressions can be misleading, while numerical
   comparisons reveal whether differences are substantively large or
   small.
   #+end_quote

8. How should you approach uncertainty about the reliability of data
   sources used in a plot?
   #+begin_quote
   By separating concerns about data quality from concerns about how
   the data are selected, framed, and visualized.
   #+end_quote

9. What does it mean to say that a visualization is
   “narrative-driven”?
   #+begin_quote
   It means the visualization is designed to support a particular
   story or takeaway rather than to present a complete or neutral
   view.
   #+end_quote

10. Why is it important to consider which data are missing, not just
    which data are shown?
    #+begin_quote
    Because omitted data can change the interpretation entirely and
    may conceal the most important or informative patterns.
    #+end_quote

11. Why must observed correlations in a plot not be interpreted
    automatically as causal relationships?
    #+begin_quote
    Because correlation only shows that variables move together, not
    that one causes the other; external factors or reverse causality
    may be responsible.
    #+end_quote

- You have to upload the URL of your finished file to Canvas.

* First assignments

- There is no class on Monday (MLK day).

- The "Intermediate R" lessons from DataCamp are available.

- You need to join my new workspace (see Course Links in Canvas Pages).

- We'll look at projects next Wednesday.

- There will be a lab assignment based on the Colab exercise.

* Getting started with Colab

Let's make a simple plot with R in Colab to revisit what you already
know.

1) Logon to your Lyon Google account.
2) Open ~colab.research.google.com~.
3) Create a ~New notebook~.
4) Download the ~iris~ dataset from Kaggle.
5) Load dataset into a ~data.frame~
6) Include exception handling with ~tryCatch~
7) Explore the dataset.
8) Create a simple plot.
9) Customize the plot.
10) Summarize and check your understanding with a lab exercise.

Lecture available [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds2-26/blob/main/ipynb/0_colab.ipynb][in GitHub]] (static) and [[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YRme5Q016McFl_TGk3D35DT8MZYfB2Du?usp=sharing][in Colab]] (interactive). To
open in Colab, use: [[https://tinyurl.com/colab-starter-ipynb][tinyurl.com/colab-starter-ipynb]] (make copy).

* Getting started with Colab - Lab exercise

Test your understanding of "Getting started with Colab" by creating a
notebook for the Palmer Penguin dataset available for you online from:
[[https://tinyurl.com/palmer-data-csv][tinyurl.com/palmer-data-csv]].

Tasks:
1) Create a new Colab notebook.
2) Load the dataset into a dataframe.
3) Check if the dataset is loaded in the current namespace.
4) Display the first few lines of the dataset.
5) Make a simple plot of the =bill_length_mm= vs. =bill_depth_mm=.
6) Make a fully customized plot of the dataset grouping by =species=.
7) Upload the URL to your notebook to Canvas.
