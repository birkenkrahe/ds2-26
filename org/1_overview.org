What's your interpretation of this map in the context of our course?

#+begin_notes
- The map is part of a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds2-25/blob/main/img/middle_earth2.jpg][greater map of Middle Earth]] (< 10%).
- A map is one of many *metaphors* for learning (see below).
- Different people have different *external* maps (see below).
- To learn anything you need to develop an *internal* map.
- Your internal map should be *personal*, *professional* & *passionate*.
- Personal e.g. /"I really like high performance code."/
- Professional e.g. /"Better business decisions based on data."/
- Passionate: /"I'm fascinated by understanding human behavior through
  data."/

* Data Science through Metaphor (A word from our sponsor)

Metaphors can be a useful way of approaching a journey when you don't
really know yet where it is going or what you need to undertake it.

** The Quarry: The Data Science Mountain
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
#+caption: Data Science Mountain
[[../img/data_science_mountain.png]]

The journey to mastering Data Science can be seen as climbing a
mountain, with different stages of learning represented by
different levels on the mountain.

1) *Basecamp:* Foundational Skills
- Mathematics (Probability, Statistics, Linear Algebra)
- Programming (Python, R)
- Data Management (SQL)

2) *Mid-Level Trails:* Data Wrangling and EDA
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Visualization (ggplot2, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

3) *Summit:* Real-World Applications
- Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised Learning)
- Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing
- Ethical AI and Decision Science

** Query: The Data Science Compass
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
#+caption: Data Science Compass
[[../img/data_science_compass.png]]

A compass can help guide learners through the core areas of Data
Science, ensuring balanced growth in four key directions.

Cardinal Directions:
- *North:* Math & Statistics
- *East:* Programming & Tools (Python, R, SQL, Git)
- *South:* Data Analysis & Visualization (EDA, Reporting, Dashboards)
- *West:* Machine Learning & AI (Supervised Learning, Deep Learning,
  NLP)

** The Quest: The Data Science Map of Realms
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
#+caption: Data Science Map
[[../img/data_science_map.png]]

Imagine Data Science as a fantasy world, divided into distinct
regions, each representing a key area of learning.

Regions:
- The Realm of Programming: Python, R, SQL, Git
- The Kingdom of Math & Stats: Probability, Hypothesis Testing, Linear
  Algebra
- The Land of Data Wrangling: Pandas, Data Cleaning
- The Visualization Isles: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, ggplot2
- The Machine Learning Mountains: Supervised Learning, Deep Learning,
  Natural Language Processing
- The Ethics Forest: Data Privacy, Fairness, Bias

#+attr_latex: :width 600px
#+caption: Scrum sprint review and IMRaD publishing framework
[[../img/0_scrum.png]]

- Scrum is an important software engineering technique.

- IMRaD is an important framework to publish scientific papers.

- DevOps relate to the interface between software development and IT
  operations as data projects scale and become more complex.

- Modern ML workflows are highly layered and infrastructure-heavy
  (cp. the editorial by Andrew Ng [[https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAo6qpNb8/PkE1K5P34lg/PkE1K5P34lg?cls=10][shared in the Google Chat]]).

*** Sprint 1: Introduction (Project Idea)

- Students present the problem they want to solve, dataset
  description, and potential impact.

*** Sprint 2: Literature Review (Methods)

- Research appropriate methods, justify the choice, and plan
  implementation.

*** Sprint 3: Abstract (Results)

- Summarize progress, present preliminary results, and discuss
  challenges.

*** Sprint 4: Final Presentation

- Deliver a polished presentation, including project outcomes, lessons
  learned, and future directions.

* What should we do as a project?

- For your term project, *pick a data science application or package*.

- The application exploration should include *examples and tests*

- Your final deliverable should be a *literate program* (notebook).

- The final presentation should include *exercises* for the audience

* Which tools are you going to use?

- +[[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/R-programming][DataCamp courses]] (weekly home assignments)+

- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/ds2][GitHub repository]] (all course materials except tests)

- +[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][GNU Emacs + ESS + R]] (literate programming environment)+

- +DataCamp's DataLab and+ Google Colaboratory notebooks +(sometimes)+.

- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/][Canvas]] (learning management system)

* Linux, of course (but only in Google Colab)
#+attr_html: :width 600px: 
#+caption: Rivendell
[[../img/rivendell.jpg]]

- *You should:* Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on your PC,
  then learn the command line with [[https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php][Shotts' book (5e, 2023)]] (CSC 420).

- Recall: When you cannot install a package because of your version of
  R, you can look for a compatible version:
  1) check your R =version= and then pick an earlier package version
     using the [[https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/MASS/][CRAN archive]].
  2) Example: Installing =MASS=. If you have R version 4.0.4
     (2021-02-15), then version 7.3.54 from 2021-05-03 is a safe bet:
     #+begin_example R
     install.packages("remotes")
     require(remotes)
     install_version("MASS", version="7.3.54")
     library(MASS)
     search()  # MASS appears in environment list
     #+end_example

* How can you register at DataCamp?

- We will not work with DataCamp but you can use it this term.
  
- You find the invitation link to the group for Spring 26 [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1041/pages/course-links][in Canvas]].

- These accounts will be valid until June.

* AI 2023 to 2026: Instructional evolution

Since 2022, the language (R) did not change, the answers barely
changed, but the teaching stance of AI changed a lot: ChatGPT is now
more focused on the intent behind the question, and the stability of
the answer.

- Spring 2023

  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  #+caption: ChatGPT in Spring 2025
  [[../img/0_chatgpt2.png]]

- Spring 2026:
  1) ChatGPT (5.2): very terse (gives only the =1:10= method).
  2) Gemini (3): complete: =1:10=, ~seq()~, and ~c()~ with lecture.
  3) Grok 4: =1:10= and ~c()~ function (short explanation).
  4) Claude (Sonnet 4.5): most complete (with short explanation).

* How to handle AI for coding and data science
#+attr_html: :width 650px:
#+caption: AI and the Garden of Eden
[[../img/ai_garden_of_eden.png]]

- 2024, I wrote "A note on using AI to write code for you"
  ([[https://tinyurl.com/Using-AI-to-code][tinyurl.com/Using-AI-to-code]]) and updated it in Fall 2025.

- My recommendation then was: Experiment with it but don't get
  dependent on it. My views have changed since then (as has AI):

- But that's like saying: Start smoking but don't get addicted to
  it. It's not possible. Using AI will change your coding habits
  profoundly - (practically & psychologically, not chemically).

- *The bad news:* It'll make you dumber and perhaps not even faster, and
  you'll depend on it until you decide to wean yourself off it.

- *The good news:* Everybody else is doing it anyway, and if you both
  know how it works and maintain your independence, you may thrive.

- *I use AI for:* Everything. Multiple-choice test creation; 2nd coding
  opinion; last-resort debugging; project identification; literature
  search, assignments, lectures, brainstorming. Mulitple models.

- *What should you do?* Learn to master it by using it often without
  giving up on coding altogether - discipline yourself to take breaks
  so as not get dependent on it. Don't "vibe code" in this class.

- *Vibe coding*?
  #+begin_quote
  Using AI to do absolutely all of the coding, debugging, building and
  testing. This means 100% dependency on AI, which only real experts
  can do responsibly, or non-coders who don't care about success.
  #+end_quote  

* What am I looking forward to?
#+attr_html: :width 600px
#+attr_html: What are you looking forward to? (Unsplash)
[[../img/shire.jpg]]

- Reconnecting with a language you know (R, C++, SQL) is fun.

- Reconnecting with a language (R) at a deeper level is fun.

- Looking forward to learn from *your projects*! They're always great.

- Learning more about the *object-oriented* aspects of R.

- Dealing another blow to the *"Tidyverse"* (cp. "[[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][TidyverseSceptic]]").

- Picking up a little more *Python* along the way (perhaps).

* When is the first assignment due?

- First DataCamp lesson "Conditionals and Control Flow" is due next
  week on Wednesday (part of "[[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-r][Intermediate R]]").

* Next topics
