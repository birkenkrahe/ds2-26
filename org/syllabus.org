* Course Description

This course continues the journey into data science using the
functional, object-oriented statistical programming language R, begun
in DSC 105, "Introduction to data science". It includes calling and
writing functions, conditional and looping statements. We will also
explore data science using command line UNIX tools, and several
packages permitting performance improvement and database connections,
like Rcpp and RSQLite. If time permits, we will look at big data
frameworks like Apache Spark, and at running data science experiments
in containers. We will also bring in more Python towards the end.

Students will learn to critically use AI-assisted programming tools to
explore models, generate hypotheses, and refine analyses, while
retaining responsibility for correctness and interpretation.

* Student learning outcomes

Students who complete DSC 205, "Introduction to advanced data
science", will be able to:
- Import data into R, store them, and transform them for analysis
- Visualize data as part of advanced explorative data analysis
- Understand basic predictive modeling strategies and methods
- Master statistical programming in R
- Learn how to process data on the command-line
- Learn data science optimization with C++
- Learn how to write efficient functions
- Master the infrastructure for advanced statistical computing
- Know how to effectively present assignment results
- Be ready for advanced data science courses like data
  visualization (DSC 302) and machine learning (DSC 305)
- Research and present a project 

* Course requirements

Introductory knowledge of R as taught in DSC 105 or obtained
independently by completing chapters 1-15 of the free online resource
“fasteR: Fast Lane to Learning R!”, or Davies, The Book of R
(NoStarch, 2016, Part I only). Basic R concepts are repeated and
practiced at the start of the term.

* Grading System

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION             | IMPACT |
|---------+-------------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | Programming Assignments |    25% |
| Weekly  | Multiple choice tests   |    25% |
| Monthly | Project sprint reviews  |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam (optional)   |    25% |

Notes:
- *To pass:* 60% of all available points.
- *Tests:* weekly online quizzes based on classroom lectures and
  practice.
- *Final exam:* random selection of the known test questions in the form
  of an oral exam. *Note:* You only have to attempt the final exam if
  you want to improve your grade at the end of the course. If the
  final exam result is below your final grade average up to this
  point, it will be ignored.

* Use of AI-Assisted Programming Tools

Students may use AI-assisted programming tools (such as large language
models) as part of their exploratory and iterative work in this
course. These tools are intended to support idea generation, code
drafting, and comparison of alternative approaches, not to replace
conceptual understanding or independent reasoning. Students are
responsible for the correctness, interpretation, and justification of
all submitted work and must be able to explain and defend their
analyses and code. Use of AI tools that obscures authorship, bypasses
understanding, or violates the Honor Code is not permitted.

* Course Outline

This course is organized into four connected parts that develop practical,
intermediate-to-advanced data science skills with an emphasis on *programming
discipline*, *reproducibility*, and *performance*. The course combines hands-on
programming, command-line data processing, function design, and performance
optimization. Weekly assignments and in-class exercises build cumulatively
toward an individual or team-based term project.
