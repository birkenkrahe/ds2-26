* Objectives

This course builds on the conceptual foundations of data science
introduced in DSC 105 and transitions students from introductory
statistical analysis to decision-oriented data science. Using Bradford
Tuckfield’s Dive into Data Science as the primary text, the course
emphasizes exploratory reasoning, predictive modeling, statistical
inference, experimentation, and data-driven decision making.

While students enter the course with experience in R, the course
introduces Python as a second data science language, focusing on
conceptual transfer rather than language-specific mastery. Students
will learn to frame real-world questions, select appropriate models,
evaluate uncertainty, and communicate results effectively. The course
also introduces key applied areas of modern data science, including
classification, supervised and unsupervised learning, recommendation
systems, web data collection, and natural language processing.

* Student learning outcomes

Students who complete DSC 205, "Introduction to advanced data
science", will be able to:
- Translate real-world questions into analyzable data science problems
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns, structure,
  and limitations in datasets
- Visualize data effectively to support reasoning and communication
- Apply regression and forecasting models and assess their assumptions
  and limitations
- Compare groups using statistical inference and hypothesis testing
- Design, analyze, and interpret A/B tests and controlled experiments
- Build and evaluate binary classification models, including logistic
  regression
- Apply supervised learning methods and reason about accuracy,
  interpretability, and tradeoffs
- Use unsupervised learning techniques to discover structure in data
- Understand and implement basic recommendation systems
- Apply foundational natural language processing techniques using
  vector-based representations
- Collect and prepare data from the web using scraping techniques
- Work with multiple data science tools and languages, including
  Python, SQL, and R
- Communicate data-driven insights clearly in written, visual, and
  oral form
- Design and present an end-to-end data science project

* Course requirements

Students are expected to have completed DSC 105: Introduction to Data
Science, where they learned core data science concepts using the R
programming language. Prior experience includes basic data import,
data manipulation, visualization, and introductory statistical
analysis in R.

No prior experience with Python is required. Python will be introduced
as a second data science language early in the course, with emphasis
on conceptual continuity rather than syntactic detail. Basic R
concepts may be revisited briefly as points of comparison, but the
course assumes students are already familiar with fundamental data
science workflows.

Students should be prepared to engage with assigned readings before
class, participate in discussion-based sessions, and complete applied
programming and analysis assignments throughout the term.

* Grading System

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION            | IMPACT |
|---------+------------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | Assignments            |    25% |
| Weekly  | Multiple choice tests  |    25% |
| Monthly | Project sprint reviews |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam (optional)  |    25% |

Notes:
- *To pass:* 60% of all available points.
- *Tests:* weekly online quizzes based on classroom lectures and
  practice.
- *Final exam:* random selection of the known test questions in the form
  of an oral exam. *Note:* You only have to attempt the final exam if
  you want to improve your grade at the end of the course. If the
  final exam result is below your final grade average up to this
  point, it will be ignored.

For *important dates*, see the 2025-2026 Academic Calendar at:
[[https://catalog.lyon.edu/202526-academic-calendar][catalog.lyon.edu/202526-academic-calendar]]

- Time in class: approximately 40 hours
- Time outside of class: approximately 100 hours, including readings,
  take-home MPC tests, programming assignments, and a semester-long
  term project
- Total workload over the term: approximately 140 hours
- Average weekly workload outside of class: approximately 8-9 hours

Workload varies across the semester and increases around sprint

* Course Outline

The course is organized into *four parts*, each corresponding to a
distinct phase of the data science workflow. In addition to weekly
readings and programming assignments, students complete a *freely
chosen term project* that spans the entire semester. The project is
developed incrementally through *four sprint reviews*, each aligned with
a core component of data science practice.
